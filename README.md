# Animal shelter manager application
This project serves as a trainig implementation for an animal shelter, providing solutions for animal care.  
The application ofers RESTful endpoints for managing animals, their living spaces, and archiving various actions performed with animals such as walking, vaccinating, adopting or changing rooms.

This is a training project designed to showcase fundamental concepts. If you find the functionality intriguing, your contributions and ideas are highly encouraged. This project has the potential for expansion based on interest, making it an opportunity to develope the project or to support institutions working with animals.
